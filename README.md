Poem Website

This project is a dynamic poem website built with EJS, Node.js, and Express. It showcases a collection of poems and allows users to view and enjoy them in a streamlined, interactive environment.

Key Features:

Dynamic Content Rendering: Utilizes EJS (Embedded JavaScript) to render poem content dynamically without relying on a traditional database.
Express Framework: Leverages Express.js for efficient routing and server-side handling.
Node.js Backend: Provides a robust backend environment to manage and serve poem data seamlessly.
Technologies Used:

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): For templating and rendering dynamic content.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side logic.
Express: Web application framework for Node.js to handle routing and server requests.
How It Works:

The website stores poem data in-memory and uses EJS templates to display poems dynamically. This approach eliminates the need for a database, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

Target Audience:

This project is ideal for poetry enthusiasts and anyone interested in exploring dynamic web applications without the complexity of database management.

Feel free to adjust any part of this to better fit your project or personal style!
